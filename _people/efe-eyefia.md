Eferhonore Efe-Eyefia is from Nigeria and is currently a PhD student working collaboratively with [SCI-CLAWPS]({% link _pages/home.md %}) on a collaborative projet between Mathematics and Earth & Environmental Sciences at Cardiff University, led by [Prof. Owen Jones](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/556930-jones-owen). Eferhonore received his Bachelor’s degree in Industrial Mathematics from the Federal University of Technology Akure, Nigeria, a Master’s degree in Electronics and Information Science from University of Glamorgan Pontypridd (now University of South Wales) and a Masters degree in Industrial Mathematics from the University of Benin, Edo State Nigeria.  

He is working on simulation of rainfall events. This research aims to investigate and build good simulation models for rainfall events that can be used to fit rainfall data. This project cut across mathematics, statistics and environmental science and it is funded by TETFund.
