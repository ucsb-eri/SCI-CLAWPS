Farai is a stable isotope ecolohydrologist interested in the effects of hydrological processes on the structure and function of ecosystems and the effects of biotic processes on elements of the water cycle in semi-arid and arid environments. Currently, his work focuses on understanding recharge, water partitioning and water use strategies in riparian habitats to enable modeling of riparian responses to a warming / drying climate with a view to manage these systems which are a critical part of the dryland system. 

He is currently working with [SCI-CLAWPS]({% link _pages/home.md %}) on research advised by [Michael Singer]({% link _people/singer.md %}) and [Kelly Caylor](http://caylor.eri.ucsb.edu/people/caylor/) at the [Earth Research Institute](https://www.eri.ucsb.edu/) at [UC Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/) on a [SERDP](https://www.serdp-estcp.org/) funded project. His PhD (Indiana University, Indianapolis (2018)) and MSc work (Stellenbosch University, South Africa (2009)) focused on non-rainfall water (fog and dew) as important components of the dryland hydrological cycle (Namib Desert), as well as factors controlling precipitation isotope compositions. Other previous notable works include collaborations with the IAEA - “Stable Isotopes in Precipitation and Paleoclimatic Archives in Tropical Areas (2013 – 2017) and the BIODESERT global survey (Maestrelab).
