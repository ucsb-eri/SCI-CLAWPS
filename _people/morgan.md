Bryn is a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Geography](https://www.geog.ucsb.edu/) at the [University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB)](https://www.ucsb.edu/). . Her research interests include vegetation water use, dynamics of dryland rivers, and UAV-based remote sensing for scientific pursuits and environmental conservation. 

She is currently working on estimating evapotranspiration from thermal imagery and eddy covariance towers at the [Mpala Research Centre]( https://mpala.org) in Kenya and at the [Dangermond Preserve]( https://www.nature.org/en-us/newsroom/the-nature-conservancy-preserves-24000-acre-coastal-ranch-at-point-conceptio/). She is currently working with [SCI-CLAWPS]({% link _pages/home.md %}) on a [SERDP](https://www.serdp-estcp.org/) funded project, modeling hydrological processes in riparian environments for application in the Southwestern U.S. and Southeastern France. Bryn is also involved in an indoor cartography project, where she is using LiDAR- and Structure-from-Motion-based point clouds to resolve tree canopy geometry.

Prior to UCSB, Bryn worked as a remote sensing analyst at the Namibian Chamber of Environment in Windhoek, Namibia, working on a [wildlife aerial survey program](https://www.n-c-e.org/resource/eye-sky-game-counts). She earned a bachelorâ€™s degree in geography and chemistry from Dartmouth College in 2017.
