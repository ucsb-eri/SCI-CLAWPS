 Melissa is a PhD student in the [Stella Lab](https://stella-lab.weebly.com/people.html) at State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry.  She received her Bachelor of Science in Biology and Oceanography at the University of British Columbia, Master of Science in Water Science, Policy, and Management at Oxford University, and Master of Science in Environmental Engineering and Science at Stanford University. 

Her current work with [SCI-CLAWPS]({% link _pages/home.md %}) is on a [US National Science Foundation (NSF)](https://www.nsf.gov) funded project to assess the health of riparian ecosystems in response to groundwater decline.  Melissa is particularly interested in using cloud-based computing and Sentinel satellite imagery to monitor riparian ecosystem responses to groundwater in California.
