Saskia Salwey is a PhD student working collaboratively with [SCI-CLAWPS]({% link _pages/home.md %}) on a NERC-funded project based at the University of Bristol. Her research focuses on incorporating human-water interactions into UK hydrological models with a primary interest in reservoirs. Her work aims to improve UK streamflow simulation at both regional and national scales and to account for the effects of operational coordination and reservoir release rules on water resources. She is particularly interested in the influence of reservoirs during droughts.

Prior to starting her PhD Saskia studied Geographical Sciences at the University of Bristol. After graduating, she spent a year working in Wallingford as a water management consultant before returning to Bristol in September 2020.
