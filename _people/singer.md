Michael Singer is Deputy Director of the [Water Research Institute](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/water-research-institute) and Professor in the [School of Earth & Environmental Sciences](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/earth-ocean-sciences) at [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk), as well as a Researcher in the [Earth Research Institute](https://www.eri.ucsb.edu/) at [University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB)](https://www.ucsb.edu/). He received his PhD in Environmental Science and Management from UCSB in 2003. He is a Certified Professional Hydrologist [American Institute of Hydrology](https://www.aihydrology.org/). 

My research is focused on the regional expression of climate and climate change at and near the Earthâ€™s surface and its impact on water, plants, landscape evolution, and society. Near-surface responses to environmental change are critical to predicting the consequences of climate and land-use changes at the landscape scale, as well as for management on human/engineering timescales. I am, at the core, a watershed scientist with a research aim to advance theory and reduce uncertainty about the impact of humans and climate on water resources, water balance, hydrologic fluxes, erosion/sedimentation, and topographic evolution of landscapes. 

Michael has received research grants from many funders including the [US National Science Foundation (NSF)](https://www.nsf.gov), the [US Department of Defense's Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP)](https://www.serdp-estcp.org/), [The Nature Conservancy](https://www.nature.org/en-us/), the [UK's Global Challenges Research Fund](https://www.ukri.org/research/global-challenges-research-fund/) and the [European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en).
