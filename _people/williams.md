Jared is an MS student in the Graduate Program of Environmental Science at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY-ESF) in the [Stella Lab](https://stella-lab.weebly.com/people.html). He joined the [SCI-CLAWPS]({% link _pages/home.md %}) research group in Fall 2018. He graduate from the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) with a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Studies and a minor in Spatial Science. His undergraduate research evaluated invasive traits and genetic crossing of native, introduced, and hybrid lineages of the aggressive wetland grass, _Phragmites australis_.  

Jared’s graduate work utilizes dendrochronology and dendroisotopes as tools to evaluate the effect of drought stress on riparian trees along the Santa Clara River (SCR), California. This work is funded by [US National Science Foundation (NSF)](https://www.nsf.gov) and [The Nature Conservancy](https://www.nature.org/en-us/). The SCR has a special place in Jared’s heart, as he conducted extensive habitat restoration in the area and witnessed one California’s greatest droughts devastate the riparian community first hand. When he isn’t working, you can find Jared trying to avoid being injured while skateboarding, surfing, snowboarding, or rock climbing.
