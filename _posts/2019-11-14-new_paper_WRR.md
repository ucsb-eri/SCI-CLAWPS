The SCI-CLAWPS Research Group has a [new paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2018WR024519) in Water Resources Research, led by former group member, [Chris Sargeant](https://www.wsl.ch/en/employees/sargeant.html). The paper presents a new tool for retrospectively assessing water use by plants from annual (or subannual) rings. The method inverts the Barbour model of biochemical isotopic fractionation to convert measured values of &delta;<sup>18</sup>O in tree ring cellulose into the associated &delta;<sup>18</sup>O from water sources that were used for growth. The paper presents the method, examples of its application, and provides links to the open-source code (ISO-Tool) in a Matlab and Excel formats.
