SCI-CLAWPS PhD student, [Andres Quichimbo]({% link _people/quichimbo.md %}), published his [first thesis paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.13847) in Hydrological Processes. This paper explores the driving and subsurface controls on focused recharge (groundwater recharge through ephemeral stream beds), characteristic of drylands.
